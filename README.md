# associationDigitalArt
Small project of a website for an association centered around digital art.

Initially it was a project for a course about media on the web (so the video had to be center of attention).
However I later revisited this project to work with jQuery and show how it can be used to improve upon a website.
I used jQuery to implement a dark/light mode as well as adding a fade effect on the cards beneath the video to keep focus on the card the used wants to read
(there are however some flickering issues with the card fading).
